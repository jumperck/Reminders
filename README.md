```bash
# Run all available tests
./run-tests.sh
```

This will run:

- ✅ React/Jest unit tests (61 tests)
- ✅ Blockchain/Hardhat tests (10 tests)
- ⚠️ .NET integration tests (if API is running)

### End-to-End Testing with Cypress

Comprehensive E2E tests validate critical user interactions against the deployed application:

- **Location**: `src/test/cypress/`
- **Testing Environment**: Tests run against the deployed GitHub Pages application at `https://kaueereinbold.github.io/Reminders`
- **Coverage**: List, Create, Edit, Delete operations
- **Test categories**:
  - List functionality (viewing reminders)
  - Creation workflow (create new reminder)
  - Editing workflow (modify existing reminder)  
  - Deletion workflow (remove reminder with confirmation)
  - Integration tests (full user journeys)
- **Run tests**:
  - Interactive: `npm run cy:open` (in Cypress directory)
  - Headless: `npm run cy:run` (in Cypress directory)
  - Against local dev: `CYPRESS_baseUrl=http://localhost:3000 npm run cy:run`

For detailed testing setup and usage instructions, see:

- [Cypress Testing README](src/test/cypress/README.md)

### .NET Integration Tests

**Note**: Integration tests require the API to be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

**To run integration tests:**

```bash
# 1. Start the API and database
docker compose up postgres ganache -d
cd src/server/api/dotnet/Reminders.Api
dotnet run

# 2. In a new terminal, run the tests
cd src/test/server/dotnet/Reminders.Api.Test
dotnet test
```

**Selenium Tests**: The MVC Selenium tests require Chrome/Firefox drivers and browsers installed. These are primarily for local development and may be skipped in CI environments.

### Continuous Integration

All tests run automatically on pull requests:

- Jest unit tests via GitHub Actions
- Cypress E2E tests via GitHub Actions
- Coverage reporting and artifact collection

## Docker Compose Configuration

This section describes the Docker Compose configuration for deploying the Reminders application.

### Database Migrations

The Reminders application uses a **dedicated migration runner service** to manage database schema updates. This design decouples migration execution from API startup, providing better reliability and orchestration.

#### Migration Runner Service

- **Purpose**: Applies Entity Framework Core migrations before API instances start
- **Technology**: .NET 8.0 console application with embedded HTTP health endpoint
- **Execution**: Runs once per deployment, exits after completion (not a long-running service)
- **Health Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8081/healthz` (exposed in development mode only)
- **Location**: `src/server/services/dotnet/Reminders.MigrationsRunner/`

#### How It Works

1. **Database Ready**: PostgreSQL container starts and reports healthy via healthcheck
2. **Migrations Run**: Migration runner service starts, applies all pending migrations with retry logic (exponential backoff, 5 attempts)
3. **Health Check**: Runner exposes HTTP 500 while running, HTTP 200 on success
4. **APIs Start**: Once migration runner exits successfully (code 0), both API instances start simultaneously
5. **Production Ready**: APIs are guaranteed to have correct schema before handling requests

#### Docker Compose Orchestration

```yaml
services:
  migrations:
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
    restart: "no"  # Run once, do not restart
    
  dotnet-api:
    depends_on:
      migrations:
        condition: service_completed_successfully
```

#### Running Migrations Manually

**Local Development** (without Docker):

```bash
# Navigate to migration runner directory
cd src/server/services/dotnet/Reminders.MigrationsRunner

# Configure connection in appsettings.json or via environment
export ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection="Host=localhost;Database=Reminders;Username=postgres;Password=yourpassword"
export DatabaseProvider="Postgres"

# Run migrations
dotnet run

# Check health endpoint (in another terminal)
curl http://localhost:8081/healthz
```

**Docker Compose** (recommended):

```bash
# Full stack with migrations
docker compose --profile all up -d

# Check migration runner logs
docker compose logs migrations

# Verify migration completed successfully
docker compose ps migrations
# Should show "Exited (0)" status
```

**Creating New Migrations**:

```bash
# From repository root
cd src/server/api/dotnet/Reminders.Api

# Create new migration for PostgreSQL
dotnet ef migrations add YourMigrationName \
  --context RemindersContext \
  --output-dir Layers/Data/EntityFramework/Postgres/Migrations

# Or for SQL Server (legacy)
dotnet ef migrations add YourMigrationName \
  --context RemindersContext \
  --output-dir Layers/Data/EntityFramework/SqlServer/Migrations
```

#### Configuration

Migration runner settings in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Host=postgres;Database=Reminders;..."
  },
  "DatabaseProvider": "Postgres",
  "MigrationRunner": {
    "MaxRetryAttempts": 5,
    "RetryBaseDelaySeconds": 2
  }
}
```

Environment variables override (Docker):

```bash
ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection="..."
DatabaseProvider="Postgres"
MigrationRunner__MaxRetryAttempts=5
MigrationRunner__RetryBaseDelaySeconds=2
```

#### Troubleshooting Migrations

**Migration Runner Fails to Start**:

```bash
# Check logs
docker compose logs migrations

# Common causes:
# - Database not ready (wait for postgres healthcheck)
# - Invalid connection string
# - Missing environment variables
```

**Migrations Fail to Apply**:

```bash
# Check detailed error in logs
docker compose logs migrations

# Manually test connection
docker compose exec postgres psql -U root -d Reminders -c "\dt"

# Reset database (caution: deletes all data)
docker compose down -v
docker compose --profile all up -d
```

**API Won't Start After Migration Failure**:

The migration runner must exit with code 0 for APIs to start. Check:

```bash
# Migration runner exit code
docker compose ps migrations

# If exit code is 1, fix the issue and restart
docker compose up migrations -d --force-recreate
```

**Multiple Providers Warning**:

When using PostgreSQL (default), you may see SQL Server migration errors in logs. This is **expected and harmless** — the migration runner applies only the provider-specific migrations.

### Local dev — Compose healthcheck & migrations

- The `postgres` service includes a `healthcheck` to report when the database is ready
- The `migrations` service depends on `postgres` with `condition: service_healthy` and runs database migrations before APIs start
- API services (`dotnet-api`, `go-api`) depend on `migrations` with `condition: service_completed_successfully`, ensuring they only start after successful migration
- The migration runner uses retry logic with exponential backoff (5 attempts, 2s base) to handle transient connection issues
- Runtime configuration for the migration runner is available in `appsettings.json` or via environment variables

To bring up only the API stack (useful for local dev):

```bash
# start postgres, migrations, ganache and api-related services
docker compose --profile api up -d --build

# verify postgres health
docker ps --filter name=reminders-postgres --format "{{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"

# check migration runner completed
docker ps --filter name=reminders-migrations-runner --format "{{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"

# check API health (after migrations complete)
curl -i http://localhost:5000/health
```


## Usage

To deploy the Reminders application using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jumperck/Reminders.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Reminders`
3. Run Docker Compose: `docker compose up -d`

The application can be accessed using the following URLs:

- **API 1:** [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
- **API 2:** [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001)
- **MVC:** [http://localhost:5050](http://localhost:5050)
- **Nginx Load Balancer:** [http://localhost:9999](http://localhost:9999)

Please note that the exact URLs may vary based on your specific configuration and environment. Adjust them accordingly.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Database Migration Warning Message

**Symptom**: When starting the API, you see an error about failed SQL Server migration.

**Cause**: The project supports both PostgreSQL and SQL Server. When using PostgreSQL (default), the SQL Server migration will fail.

**Solution**: This is **expected behavior** and harmless. The PostgreSQL migration succeeds, and you can safely ignore the SQL Server migration error. The application will run normally.

#### Ports Already in Use

**Symptom**: Docker Compose fails with "port is already allocated" error.

**Solution**:

```bash
# Check what's using the port (example for port 5432)
lsof -ti:5432 | xargs kill -9

# Or stop all containers and try again
docker compose down
docker compose --profile all up -d
```

#### Docker Build Takes Too Long

**Symptom**: Initial build takes 10+ minutes.

**Solution**: This is normal for the first build. Docker needs to:

- Download base images (.NET, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Nginx, Ganache)
- Install all dependencies
- Build all services

Subsequent builds will be much faster thanks to Docker's layer caching.

#### Cannot Connect to Database

**Symptom**: API fails to start with database connection errors.

**Solution**:

1. Ensure PostgreSQL is running: `docker compose ps`
2. Check your `.env` file has correct password
3. Verify the database container is healthy: `docker logs reminders-postgres`
4. Wait a few seconds for PostgreSQL to fully initialize

#### React App Shows API Connection Error

**Symptom**: Frontend can't connect to the API.

**Solution**:

1. Ensure API is running: `curl http://localhost:9999/health`
2. Check CORS configuration in your `.env` file
3. Verify Nginx is running: `docker compose ps reminders-nginx`
